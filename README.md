# Modulr
A server-based Java stipulator written in C#.

Because why not.

## Status
This repository is slowly maintained as more focus is on making testers (Troy High School, IB CS HL) rather than developing the interface. *Note these testers are closed-source in order to prevent academic dishonesty.*

If any students (or anybody) wants to help, feel free to fork or PR at any time.

## Usage
While not designed to be installed (yet, in the future?), Modulr is designed to run on all OSes that run ASP.NET Core and Docker.

See the sample configuration file and the SQL database template to set one up.

## Contribution
For all problems, please place them in issues. PRs are welcome, though I'm not sure how to handle them.

## License
Honestly, I don't care whoever uses this, since it's just a personal project. However, if you really care, this is under the [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) license.
